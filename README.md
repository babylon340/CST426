# CST426
=========

Release mode executables are stored under CST426/Release.

To regenerate them once destroyed, open CST426/CST426.sln in Visual Studio
and, in the top menu, click Build -> Rebuild Solution.

To run the tests in Debug mode through Visual Studio, right click on the
project name (Battle1, Battle2, etc.), left click the Debug context menu
item, then Start New Instance.

Simply hitting F5 or Debug will only run Battle1.
